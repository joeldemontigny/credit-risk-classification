# credit-risk-classification

## Background:

In this challenge, I used various techniques to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk. I used a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.

## Results:

Machine Learning Model 1 - Logistic Regression:

Accuracy: 0.9442676901753825
Precision: 1.0 / 0.87
Recall scores: 1.0 / 0.89

Machine Learning Model 2 - Logistic Regression With Resampled Data:

Accuracy: 0.994180571103648
Precision: 0.99 / 0.99
Recall scores: 0.99 / 0.99
